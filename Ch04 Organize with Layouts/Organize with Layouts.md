# Organize with Layouts
## Why Layouts?
Usually a user interface has many components (widgets) that 
should be displayed properly, if not beautifully, to have a 
good user experience. Controlling the size and position of all
widgets in a user interface that may change its size, location, 
orientation and react promptly to a user interaction is a complex
task. Kivy provides several layout widgets to automate many 
layout management tasks. Following are some layout widgets 
that help developers to manage the layout of a user interface:

* `BoxLayout`: children are arranged next to each other either in
vertical or horizontal direction. In the vertical arrangement, all
children have the same width as the parent `BoxLayout` widget. 
In the horizontal arrangement, all children have the same height
as the parent `BoyLayout` widget. 
* `GridLayout`: children are arranged in a grid that has columns 
and rows. 
* `StackLayout`: similar to `BoxLayout`, children are arranged
next to each either in vertical or horizontal direction. 
However, in the vertical arrangement, we can specify the width
of a child widget. In the horizontal arrangement, we can specify
the height of a child widget.
