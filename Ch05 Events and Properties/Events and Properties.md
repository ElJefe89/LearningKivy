# Events and Properties
## Event-Driven Applications
Most GUI applications are event-driven applications. Once a
graphic interface is displayed, an application enters a 
loop waiting for different events to happen. If an event happens, 
an application dispatches the event to its handlers, also called callbacks.
Callbacks register to the application to tell event dispatcher which 
events that they are interested. The registration process bind a 
callback to an event. A key function of a GUI framework is to register 
callbacks, monitor events, generate/transform events,  and dispatch events. 
The following diagram from [Kivy document site](http://kivy.org/docs/guide/events.html)
depicts the event process.

There are many event sources. Some events like keyboard input, 
mouse click, screen touch etc are from a GUI user. Some events
are generated by systems or even a GUI application itself. 
System events include a network disconnection, alarm timeout, 
filesystem activities etc. An application can generate or trigger 
events. For example, an application generates `on_start`, `on_stop`,
`on_pause`, and `on_resume` events when it starts, stops, pauses or 
resumes from a pause.  

## Observer Pattern
A special kind of "event" sources is a widget property. A widget 
usually has many properties such as its position, size, text 
or any value that it manages. In many cases we want to be notified 
when those values change. For example, when a widget changes it position 
to a special zone, we want to change its color. Because this is 
a very common requirement in a GUI application, Kivy defines a 
`Property` class that implements the [Observer Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern).
