# Widgets
## Introduction
A user interface usually has many elements such as input textbox, 
labels, drop down lists, button, radio buttons, etc. These elements
are called widgets in Kivy. Actually everything in the user
interface is a widget. Widgets are the building blocks of 
a Kivy graphic interface. Some widgets are not obvious. 
For example, a layout widget can contain other widgets and is used to 
arrange other widgets inside it. Developers use layout widgets 
to control the sizes and locations of its child widgets.
Kivy provides many widgets out of the box. It also let 
developers to define brand new widgets or extend/compose existing widgets
into new widgets.
