# Widgets and Layouts
## Introduction
A user interface usually has many elements such as input textbox, 
labels, drop down lists, button, radio buttons, etc. These elements
are called widgets in Kivy. Actually everything in the user
interface is a widget. Widgets are the building blocks of 
a Kivy graphic interface. Some widgets are not obvious or invisible.
A special group of widgets are layouts. A layout widget can contain 
other widgets and is used to arrange widgets inside it. 
Developers use layout widgets to control the sizes and 
locations of its child widgets. Kivy provides many widgets 
out of the box. It also let developers to define brand 
new widgets or extend/compose existing widgets
into new widgets. As shown in the previous chapter, a widget can be 
created either by Python code or by a kvlang file. Kv files are 
preferred because of its independence, simplicity, and clear syntax.
